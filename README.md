# Simple encoding

The project name is "Python Message Encoder". The goal of this project is to develop an application in Python that can encode a message using the MD5 hashing algorithm and Base64 encoding.

## Project Date

This project was originally created on May 10, 2020.

## Overview

"Python Message Encoder" is a semester group project for my Computer Science degree program at UNIP (Universidade Paulista). Our group is tasked with delivering an application that meets the functionality requirements of encoding a message using MD5 and Base64, and delivering a PDF file that includes documentation on the application's features, architecture, and implementation details.

## Requirements

The following requirements must be met in order to successfully complete the project:

- Develop a Python application that can take a message input and encode it using the MD5 hashing algorithm and Base64 encoding.
- The delivered PDF file should include documentation on the application's features, architecture, and implementation details.
- Adhere to the project timeline and submission deadlines set by the coordinator.

## Project Goals

Our team aims to:

- Develop a Python application that can accurately encode messages using the specified algorithms.
- Create clear and concise documentation that accurately represents the application's features and implementation details.
- Work collaboratively to ensure the project is completed on time and to the best of our abilities.

## Languages and Tools

The "Python Message Encoder" project was developed using the following languages and tools:

- Python programming language
- Git version control system
- GitHub for project management and collaboration
